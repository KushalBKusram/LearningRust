# LearningRust

I am using this repo to document my journey toward getting started with Rust, learning the language by completeing the exercises in (rustlings)[https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings].

## Prerequisite
I am using the default container available in VSCode `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/rust:1-1-bullseye` as my workspace, giving me a headstart. You can find the details in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. If you are not familiar in using this, refer (here)[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers]

## Install Rustlings

```
cargo install rustlings
```

## Initialization
The following command should initialize if not initialized, else resume your exercise lessons.

```
cd rustlings
rustlings init
```
